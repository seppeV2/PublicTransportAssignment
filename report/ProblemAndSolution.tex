\section{Problem statement} \label{sec:problems}
\subsection{Road Congestions}
After Munich, Berlin is the city with the most traffic jams in Germany. Peak hour traffic jams are mostly caused by the commuting people. According TomTom \cite{tomtom} data commuting people need to add 12 minutes per 30 minutes in the morning and 16 minutes per 30 minutes in the evening. As a normal employee works around 48 weeks per year and 5 days per week this results in an average time lost of 48 hours in the morning 64 hours in the evening per 30 minutes additional travelling time per year. At figure \ref{averageCongestion} the average percentages of the weekly congestion per hour are visible.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Train Delay}
A second big problem for commuting people is train delay. Typically the commuters use  the S-Bahn train \ref{sebsec:sBahn} to enter the city and the fast ICE train if they live at a greater distance of Berlin. As Jens-Peter Schulz, CEO of Dresdner Real Estate Investment Holding \& Chairman told in an article for expo real: 'Germany travellers cheer if their train arrives less than 10 minutes late'. Because the majority of the commuting people live near Berlin we will only analyse the S-Bahn train. People mostly complain that the complete railway system in Germany is not very flexible, once a train has a delay it starts a series of events that causes a lot of delays for other trains as well. Especially when the train becomes very crowded, when this happens the stop time of the trains increases every time. As that train arrives in a transfer station with a delay the other trains wait on that train so it's possible for the passengers to transfer, this results in more trains with a delay. 

\subsection{Ticket price} \label{subsec:ticketprice}
The ticket prices for public transport in Berlin are the 5th most expensive of the whole world, this is visibly at figure \ref{pricePT}. As a single ticket costs around 3.16 € and majority of the commuting people need to cover on average 14.3 Km (figure \ref{averageComDis} 2012) to go working. With an average fuel consumption of 4.1 L/100Km (2020) and a fuel price of  1,65 €/L (2021) this means going to work with the car cost around 1 € (car parks payment not included). So for people that own a car and do have a car parks spot near their work it financially seems to be more attractive to take the car .

\section{Proposals}
In this section some proposals to solve the problems discussed in section \ref{sec:problems}. There is not one right solution for these problems but as one problem is solved this will also have an impact on the others. When the trains are more reliable and cheaper more people will use them instead of taking their car, this resolves in less road congestions. Also the other way around is possible when there are less road congestions more people will take the car resolving in smaller delays for the trains as they will not be over crowded. the subsection \cref{subsec:RoadTax,subsec:parkin,subsec:resSys,subsec:ticketPriceSolution} will propose a individual solutions for each problem.

\subsection{Road Pricing} \label{subsec:RoadTax}
One of the solution on the congested roads problem could be a road pricing. There are two possibilities of  road pricing either different prices on different roads to spread the traffic better or a dynamic road pricing that would change in function of the hours. Both can obviously be combined as well. \\ \newline
Having different prices on different roads is an easy way to shift  traffic from one place to an other. The investment to make this possible is also relatively low. In Germany there is no road pricing for cars at the moment, this does not mean that it is necessary to develop a whole new system. It is possible to add just one road segment where a fee needs to be paid. Think of a tunnel or a bridge or even just a road, the only investment to make is a place to stop and pay (most of the time using a barrier). Most People will automatic avoid this road and take an other one. When a congestion occurs because of an incident the decision to make that road segment free can be made. Because of this decision the congestion on the other road will solve much easier. The down side of this solution is when the road is not free it will be used much less than before and there for the other roads will be more busy. A popular example of this solution is situated in Antwerp where the ring is very often congested. There is an other road to pass Antwerp, this road has the Liefkenshoektunnel on its path. In this tunnel normally you need to pay a fee for passing, when there is a major incident on the normal ring this tunnel is made free resolving in a smaller traffic jam.     \\ \newline
Making a variable road pricing system will spread the traffic more even through the day. A variable road pricing system means that when driving in the peak hours the price of the road is greater then when driving on more calm moments. People that do not necessary need to travel/commute at peak hours will wait or leave earlier to avoid the more expensive road pricing. A downside of this solution is that a new system needs to be introduced in Germany (or at least in Brandenburg and Berlin). \\ \newline
These systems already exist in other country but are most of the time used for trucks, it's a receiver inside the car who recognizes the different pricing zones. Some examples are ViaPass in Belgium and ViaToll in Poland. The variable road pricing can me fixed (always the same every day) or dynamic (changing on the current situation. On figure \ref{fig:dynroad} from article \cite{dynRoadPrice} is visible that the average delay decreases a lot in the peak hours.

\end{figure}

\subsection{car parks in urban fringe} \label{subsec:parkin}
An other solution for the many traffic jams could be the so called park and ride car parks with easy accessible roads. At the moment there are a few of those in the urban fringe but you still need to pay a small amount to park there. This can only be a good solution for the road congesting problem if there are good connection from that car park to the city centre. Some ideas are building the car parks near a U-Bahn of S-Bahn train stop, adding a bus stop at the car parks or making a bike sharing rental on the site. \\ \newline 
The build of these car parks and additional accommodations are big investments for the city, the roads to these car parks need to be big enough to handle the peak hours. This could also mean the start of making the city centre car free as that is something happening in a lot of big cities at the moment. An example of this is the Flanders expo car parks in Gent where you can take the tram to the city centre. 

\subsection{Variable train ticket pricing} \label{subsec:ticketPriceSolution}
A way to address the train delay problem is a dynamic train ticket price system. It would work a bit like the variable road pricing for the cars. This system would work with an magnetic card on which you put some money to pay the train ride (this can be enlarged to the whole public transport system). There would be fixed prices for each trip as it is now, the only difference would be that the prices are different for different hours. This would spread the travellers more over the whole day. \\ \newline
 Now a lot of people take the train to go to Berlin when ever they want, because of this system they would first of all think when they want to take the train so it's as cheap as possible. As we addressed in subsection \ref{subsec:ticketprice} the ticket price for the public system is very high comparing to other ways to commute, there for the prices in the peak hours shouldn't increase but the ticket price in the non peak hours should decrease. An additional feature to this system would be different subscriptions for the different times, a subscription for peak hours would be more expensive than a subscription for non-peak hours. A subscription for peak hours is also usable during non-peak hours but not the other way around. 
\subsection{Train reservation system}\label{subsec:resSys}
A second solution for the train delay problem would be a train reservation system. By adding a reservation system the train providers can anticipate on unexpected large amounts of traveller by adding some wagons to the trains. As it's obviously not possible to make a reservation on a train mandatory, there needs to be an other way to make the reservation more attractive. \\ \newline
This could be done by charging lower prices when you reserve a ticket (at least 24 hours before departure). A second way would be to guarantee a place to sit on each train, although this would be much more difficult to succeed as the rule on a train is most of the time first come first take. The system would be connected to the magnetic card so when you pay the amount is less then it would be when you didn't reserve a spot. The system of reserving a place on a train is already used on the high speed trains as the Thalys and the TGV.  
\subsection{Political change}\label{politicalChange}
A last point concerning the whole public transport is about the politics in Germany. As it is improving at the moment it still isn't completely as in the other countries. The car industry in Germany is one of the biggest industries of the whole country, there for this industry has a big influence in the German politics. That industry tried to slow the development of the public transport down. That's the reason why a lot of the train infrastructures are old an are being replaced at this moment. \\ \newline 
The last few years it's clear that the positive environmental impact of the public transport is very important, so much more money is invested in the public transport by the government. These new investments are on long term a good improvement against the train delays but at short term they cause a lot of extra delays. On figure \ref{fig:typesOfTransport} it's clear that there is still a lot of improvement possible according to more public transport and rail use compared with the car use.
